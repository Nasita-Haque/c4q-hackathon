##The problem
Growing up in New York, children are given th choice to attend schools outside of their district. With all the available options, where is a child to start? That is where (name) comes into play. This interactive website is an essential part of finding the right school for the child's education. It is targeted to both the child and parent, since choosing a school should not be the parents decision alone. 

##User Story
Billy, a 10 year old boy, is about to venture into middle school. Billy is so excited, he asks his mom, Bertha, to help him with choosing his next place of education. Billy and Bertha visit (name) and see a form asking a series of easy to follow questions. They enter Bill's age followed by his address and then are taken to a results page. They first see the list with the schools sorted by the highest ratings. This is great for Bertha, since she wants the best possible education for her son. But Billy wants to find schools that are closer so he adds an additional filter with the appropriate distance. There are still a few school on the list but Billy and his mom narrow it down to three. They select the three and are sent to another page. This page has more in depth information about the schools, as well as a map showing the distance. Bertha then saves the custom link to use later.
